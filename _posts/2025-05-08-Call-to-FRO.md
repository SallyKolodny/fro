# Call Notes

* Called at 10:40 AM, left a message asking for a statement and providing my phone number and email address
* I said I would phone back tomorrow if I didn't receive anything

# Return Call

FRO called back:

* They don't email due to fraud, so they will mail the documents, items include:
  * Statement of payments
  * Enrollment ID for online access

* They did a radical adjustment lowering my back support from over $90,000 to less than $19,000.
* The adjustment is based on the graduation dates that Tara provided to FRO:
